# Pizzeriada

## Description

"Pizzeriada" is a front-end design for a pizzeria website that allows users to see basic information about the pizzeria, browse the menu, read reviews from other customers and contact the restaurant. The site is responsive, which means it can be viewed comfortably on a variety of devices, including smartphones and tablets.
